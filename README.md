# Math Talk

A colorful Expo React Native app that helps children practice basic math through short, playful games. Each game runs for **12 questions**, tracks **high scores** (shown on a **5000-point** scale), awards **garden coins** and **badges**, and uses kid-friendly visuals, animations, and encouraging feedback.

Expo slug: **`number-match-garden`** (legacy package name).

## Math Classes (listen, answer, and watch)

Before jumping into games, kids join **Teacher Maya** for short spoken lessons with an animated **whiteboard**. A simple **teacher portrait** (👩‍🏫) appears beside the board while Maya teaches. Finish a class to unlock **only the games that class teaches** — not the whole category tree at once.

| # | Class | What it teaches | Unlocks |
|---|-------|-----------------|---------|
| 1 | 🔢 **Counting Class** | Count objects one by one | Counting games (dots, number match) |
| 2 | 🔷 **Shapes Class** | Circles, squares, triangles & more | Shape games (name, sides, count) |
| 3 | ⚖️ **Compare Class** | Bigger and smaller numbers | Compare games |
| 4 | 🦉 **Even & Odd Class** | Even vs odd numbers | Parity games |
| 5 | ➕ **Addition Class** | Putting groups together (+) | Addition games |
| 6 | ➖ **Subtraction Class** | Taking away (−) | Subtraction games |
| 7 | ✖️ **Multiplication Class** | Equal groups (×) | Multiplication games |
| 8 | ➗ **Division Class** | Sharing equally (÷) | Division games |
| 9 | 🔮 **Patterns Class** | Sequences and skip counting | Pattern games |
| 10 | 🎲 **Mixed Operations Class** | + − × ÷ together | Mixed games |
| 11 | 📐 **BODMAS Intro Class** | Order of operations overview | BODMAS Order Quiz |
| 12 | 🪝 **Brackets Class** | Brackets `( )` first | Bracket BODMAS games |
| 13 | ⏩ **Multiply & Divide First Class** | × and ÷ before + and − | ×÷-first BODMAS games |
| 14 | 🏆 **Full BODMAS Class** | Full rule: brackets → ×÷ → +− | Full BODMAS games |
| 15 | 🥇 **Challenge Class** | Expert mixed practice | Challenge games |

**Class order:** Counting → Shapes → Compare → Even & Odd → Addition → Subtraction → Multiplication → Division → Patterns → Mixed → BODMAS Intro → Brackets → ×÷ First → Full BODMAS → Challenge.

Class progress is saved in `@mathGarden/progress` under `lessons` (current step index and completion flag).

### Classroom experience

- **Teacher Maya** speaks each slide aloud (`expo-speech`) while the **whiteboard** draws circles, groups, and equations step by step
- **Simple teacher portrait** — a round 👩‍🏫 image with Maya’s name plate (no custom avatar figure); gentle pulse while she is speaking
- **Interactive counting:** Maya pauses and asks the child to say or tap the answer; correct answers get praise, wrong answers get a gentle “try again” without stopping the lesson
- **Board highlighting:** on counting slides, flowers/dots on the board are highlighted one by one as Maya counts; a 👇 marker points at the active item
- **Silence reprompt:** if no answer is heard for ~6 seconds (`ANSWER_SILENCE_MS`), Maya asks again politely
- **Next Step** stays disabled until Maya finishes the current slide narration (button shows “Listen to Teacher Maya first”)
- Tap **🔊 Hear again** to replay the teacher; captions show the same words on screen
- **Save & resume:** finish a step → leave and return later to **continue on the next step**; leave mid-step → **restart that same step**
- Class cards show **“Continue step N →”** when a class is in progress
- **Replay classes** anytime from the class list — replays do **not** change saved progress or re-lock games

### Strict game unlock rules

You can **only play games tied to classes you have finished**. The home screen groups games **by class**, not by loose categories. Locked sections show a hint (e.g. “Finish Compare Class first!”).

Unlock logic lives in `lessonMap.js` (`resolveLessonId`, `isGameUnlockedByLesson`, `getLessonGameSections`).

## Learning path & levels

### Learning path bar

The home screen shows a **step-by-step path** (Plus → Minus → Times → Divide → Patterns → Mixed → BODMAS → Challenge) that lights up as you complete the matching classes.

### 10 levels per game (2 tiers)

Every game has **10 levels** in two tiers:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🌱 **Starter** | Levels 1–10 — numbers get slightly harder each level |
| 🔥 **Advanced** | Unlocks after passing all 10 Starter levels — same game, tougher numbers |

- Each level is one full game session (**12 questions**).
- **Pass a level:** score **8 or more** correct out of 12 (`PASS_SCORE` in `progression.js`).
- Passing a level unlocks the next level in that game.
- Progress is saved locally under `@mathGarden/progress`.

### Score display (5000 scale)

Gameplay still uses **12 rounds**, but scores are shown on a kid-friendly **0–5000** scale (perfect run = **5000/5000**). Internal correct counts (0–12) are scaled for display only (`MAX_SCORE = 5000` in `App.js`).

### Speak your answer (voice input)

During games, students can **tap the microphone** and **say the answer out loud** (e.g. “five”, “12”, “three”). The app listens and picks the matching choice. Tap buttons always work as a backup.

- Uses `expo-speech-recognition` (microphone + speech recognition permissions)
- Works in a **development build** (`npx expo run:android` / `run:ios`)
- In **Expo Go**, voice is unavailable — tap number buttons in games and class answer panels instead
- Supports spoken number words (one–twenty) and digits

## Features

- **Interactive Math Classes** — Teacher Maya at the whiteboard with a simple portrait, tap/voice answers on counting slides
- **Per-class game unlock** — finish Counting Class → counting games only; Compare Class → compare games only; and so on
- **Class replay** — review any completed class without resetting progress
- **Reset all progress** — home-screen button clears classes, coins, badges, scores, and locks games again (with confirmation)
- **Speak your answer** — tap 🎤 in games (dev build) via `expo-speech-recognition`
- **83 math mini-games** covering counting, shapes, compare, even/odd, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, patterns, mixed, BODMAS, and challenge modes
- **12 questions per game** with 4 multiple-choice answers each
- **Star ratings** (0–3 stars) based on correct answers out of 12
- **High score tracking** saved locally with AsyncStorage
- **Garden coins & badges** — earn coins and unlock **450+ achievement badges**
- **Home screen summary** — coins, badge progress, learning path, top score, and per-game best scores on each card
- **Grouped game menu** — sections follow the **15 Math Classes** order
- **High Scores dashboard** — stats, sorted leaderboard, and full badge collection
- **Animated UI** with gradients, bouncing dots, button feedback, and progress bar
- **Portrait-only**, light theme; test in **Expo Go**, voice in **dev builds**

| **Screens** | Menu (by class), classes list, classroom, level select, game play, dashboard |
| **Constants** | `MAX_ROUNDS = 12`, `MAX_SCORE = 5000`, `PASS_SCORE = 8`, `GAMES` from `games.js` |
| **Storage keys** | `@mathGarden/highScores`, `@mathGarden/rewards`, `@mathGarden/progress` |
| **Classes** | `LESSONS` (15 classes), `getResumeSlideIndex`, `saveLessonCheckpoint`, `markLessonStepComplete`, replay-safe progress in `lessons.js` |
| **Teacher** | `teacherConfig.js` — change `TEACHER_NAME`, `TEACHER_LABEL`, or `TEACHER_EMOJI` in one place |
| **Unlock** | `lessonMap.js` maps each game to a class; `progression.js` checks level/tier unlock |
| **Voice** | `voiceAnswer.js` + `VoiceAnswerPanel.js`; disabled in Expo Go when native module missing |

## Configuration

Key values in `app.json` and `teacherConfig.js`:

- **Name:** Math Talk
- **Teacher:** Maya (`Teacher Maya` in UI, `👩‍🏫` portrait)
- **SDK:** 54.0.0
- **Orientation:** portrait
- **Splash background:** `#e9f7ee`
- **Android package:** `com.anonymous.numbermatchgarden`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Expo Go SDK mismatch | Update Expo Go from the app store; project uses **Expo SDK 54** |
| App won’t connect | Same Wi‑Fi, disable VPN/firewall, use `--lan` |
| Stale bundle / old UI | Restart with cache clear: `npx expo start -c` |
| Metro port conflict | Accept the alternate port and rescan the QR code |
| Voice / mic not working | Use `npx expo run:android` or `run:ios`; Expo Go may not load speech recognition |
| `ExpoSpeechRecognition` error | Expected in Expo Go — tap answers instead; dev build required for voice |
| Scores or rewards missing | Data is local to the device; reinstalling Expo Go may clear it |
| Reset everything | Home screen → **↺ Reset all progress** (clears all three storage keys) |

## License

Private project (`"private": true` in `package.json`).
