# Math Garden

A colorful Expo React Native app that helps children practice basic math through short, playful games. Each game runs for **12 questions**, tracks **high scores**, awards **garden coins** and **badges**, and uses kid-friendly visuals, animations, and encouraging feedback.

Also published in Expo as **Number Match Garden** (`number-match-garden`).

## Math Classes (learn before you play)

Before jumping into games, kids can take **short teaching classes** with pictures, stories, and simple examples:

| Class | What it teaches | Unlocks |
|-------|-----------------|---------|
| 🔢 **Counting Class** | Count objects one by one | Optional intro (counting games always open) |
| ➕ **Addition Class** | Putting groups together (+) | **Addition games** |
| ➖ **Subtraction Class** | Taking away (−) | **Subtraction games** (after Addition Class) |
| ✖️ **Multiplication Class** | Equal groups (×) | **Multiplication games** (after Subtraction Class) |
| ➗ **Division Class** | Sharing equally (÷) | **Division games** + Patterns / Mixed / Challenge |

Each class has **4–5 kid-friendly slides** with visual examples (apples, cookies, groups, equations). Tap **Start Class** on the home screen to open the class list. Finish a class to unlock games for that skill.

Class progress is saved in `@mathGarden/progress` under `lessons`.

## Learning path & levels

Math Garden uses a **step-by-step learning path** so kids master each operation before moving on:

| Step | Unlocks when |
|------|----------------|
| ➕ **Plus** (Addition) | Complete **Addition Class**, then play games |
| ➖ **Minus** (Subtraction) | Complete **Subtraction Class** + pass Level 3 in an addition game |
| ✖️ **Times** (Multiplication) | Complete **Multiplication Class** + pass Level 3 in a subtraction game |
| ➗ **Divide** (Division) | Complete **Division Class** + pass Level 3 in a multiplication game |
| 🔮 Patterns / 🎲 Mixed / 🏆 Challenge | Complete **Division Class** + pass Level 3 in a division game |

**Counting** games are always available as a gentle starting point.

### 10 levels per game (2 tiers)

Every game has **10 levels** in two tiers:

| Tier | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 🌱 **Starter** | Levels 1–10 — numbers get slightly harder each level |
| 🔥 **Advanced** | Unlocks after passing all 10 Starter levels — same game, tougher numbers |

- Each level is one full game session (**12 questions**).
- **Pass a level:** score **8 or more** out of 12.
- Passing a level unlocks the next level in that game.
- Progress is saved locally under `@mathGarden/progress`.

**`App.js`** handles screens, styling, high scores, and rewards. **`games.js`** defines all games and generates each round. **`badges.js`** builds and evaluates badges from the game list.

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Screens** | Menu (grouped by category), game play, high scores dashboard |
| **Constants** | `MAX_ROUNDS = 12`, `GAMES` from `games.js`, theme colors |
| **Storage keys** | `@mathGarden/highScores`, `@mathGarden/rewards`, `@mathGarden/progress` |
| **Functions** | `loadHighScores`, `saveHighScore`, `loadRewards`, `applyRewards` |
| **Games** | `createRound`, `getGamesByCategory`, UI helpers in `games.js` |
| **Progression** | `getScaledConfig`, `recordLevelResult`, unlock checks in `progression.js` |
| **Classes** | `LESSONS`, slide content, `completeLesson` in `lessons.js` |
| **Badges** | `buildBadges`, `evaluateBadges`, `updateRewardStats` in `badges.js` |

## Configuration

Key values in `app.json`:

- **SDK:** 54.0.0
- **Orientation:** portrait
- **Splash background:** `#e9f7ee`
- **Android package:** `com.anonymous.numbermatchgarden`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | What to try |
|-------|-------------|
| Expo Go SDK mismatch | Update Expo Go from the app store; project uses **Expo SDK 54** |
| App won’t connect | Same Wi‑Fi, disable VPN/firewall, use `--lan` |
| Stale bundle / old UI | Restart with cache clear: `npx expo start -c` |
| Metro port conflict | Accept the alternate port and rescan the QR code |
| Scores or rewards missing | Data is local to the device; reinstalling Expo Go may clear it |

## License

Private project (`"private": true` in `package.json`).
